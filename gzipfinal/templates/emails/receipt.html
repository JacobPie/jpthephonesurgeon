            Every order counts and really makes a difference to a small business like us.
            Now that you have paid for the repair, your new part will be sent to our HQ.
            Once the part arrives and is tested for quality, you will receive an email to schedule your repair.
            This will happen in 3-5 business days!
            Thanks again for the order.
